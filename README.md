## Problem Statement
General, deaf people have difficulty in communicating with others who don’t understand sign language. Even those who do speak aloud typically have a “deaf voice” of which they are self-conscious and that can make them reticent. The Hand Talk glove is a normal, cloth driving glove fitted with flex sensors along the length of each finger and the thumb. The sensors output a stream of data that varies with degree of bend. The output from the sensor is analog values it is converted to digital and processed by using microcontroller and then it will be transmitted through wireless communication(Bluetooth), then it will be received in the receiver section and processed.Which will further be converted to speech.
